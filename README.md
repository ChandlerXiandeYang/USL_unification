# üìò How to Use the Code to Verify the Output in the Manuscript

The file `Code_and_its_output_for_the_manuscript.qmd` contains all the code used in the manuscript titled:

**"Specification Limit Normalization for Nonparametric Process Capability Analysis and Its Application in Cleaning Validation with AI-Enabled Monitoring Models."**

## üîß Steps to Reproduce the Output

1. **Download the data** from the folder named **"Equipment A."**
2. **Download the file** `Code_and_its_output_for_the_manuscript.qmd`.
3. **Update the file path** in the `.qmd` file to reflect the location where you saved the data.
4. **Run the file** in RStudio or use the `quarto::quarto_render()` function in R.
5. The output will include **15 tables** labeled Table 1 to Table 15.  
   > **Note:** The tables in the manuscript are numbered one higher than those generated (i.e., Table 1 in the code corresponds to Table 2 in the manuscript).

# üß† How to Use the Functions

This section is for users who want to understand the functions or apply them in business operations.

## üìè USL-Normalization Functions

### 1 A single CQA uses Ppu_KDEDPonUSLND method:
- `Ppu_KDEDPonUSLND`: Calculates Ppu using USL-normalized data.
- `Ppu_BAKDEDPonUSLND`: Calculates Ppu and its 95% confidence interval using bootstrap.

### 2 CQAWWC_KDEDPonUSLDN is CQA-wise worst case overall Ppu assessing a cleaning process who has 1 to 3 CQAs (DAR, CAR, Mic):
- `CQAWWC_KDEDPonUSLND`: Computes CQA-wise worst-case Ppu.
- `CQAWWC_BAKDEDPonUSLND`: Computes Ppu and 95% CI using bootstrap.

### 3 CQAWP_KDEDPonUSLND is CQA-wise pooling case overall Ppu assessing a cleaning process who has 1 to 3 CQAs (DAR, CAR, Mic):
- `CQAWP_KDEDPonUSLND`: Computes pooled Ppu for 1‚Äì3 CQAs.
- `CQAWP_BAKDEDPonUSLND`: Computes pooled Ppu and 95% CI using bootstrap.

### Monitoring Models:
- **Model 1**: Combines 1 + 2 + `CQAWWC_KDEDPonUSLND_CVStage3Monitoring`
- **Model 2**: Combines 1 + 3 + `CQAWWC_KDEDPonUSLND_CVStage3Monitoring`

> **Note:** Bootstrap uses 1,000 iterations by default. If the confidence interval length (CIL) is less than 1 during training, it switches to 10,000 iterations. Bandwidth (`BW`) options include: `Silver1.06`, `Silver0.9`, `Silver0.9IQR`, or user-defined.

## üìä Traditional Ppu Methods

### For a single CQA:
- **Method 1**: Split data into subgroups and use `Ppu_KDEDP` (no USL normalization). This is the traditional way.
- **Method 2**: Use `Ppu_SWWC_KDEDP` to compute worst-case Ppu across subgroups. This is the traditional way.
  
  > Note: `Ppu_SWWC_KDEDP` uses `Ppu_KDEDPonUSLND` internally, as Ppu is invariant to USL-normalization. In fact, change `Ppu_KDEDPonUSLND` by `Ppu_KDEDP` in `Ppu_SWWC_KDEDP`, it also works and the output is the same since Ppu, Ppl, and Ppk are USL-normalizaiton invariants.

### For 1 to 3 CQAs:
- `Ppu_SWWC_KDEDP_overall`: Computes worst-case Ppu across all CQAs, representing the overall cleaning process capability. This is the traditional way.

## üìê Bandwidth Function Clarification



Although **JMP** claims its bandwidth formula is: BW = 0.9 * s / n^(1/5)
where:
- `s` is the **uncorrected** sample standard deviation (i.e., divided by `n`, not `n - 1`)
- the **grid size** is set to 100
- However, this is **not the case** based on our findings. We observed that:

- The actual bandwidth formula should be: BW = 1.06 * s / n^(1/5)
- where `s` is the **corrected** sample standard deviation (i.e., divided by `n - 1`)

- The grid size should be **much larger** than 100. We recommend using: grid size = 2^15
  
This adjustment provides more accurate density estimation and better alignment with theoretical expectations.

All functions in the code allow manual input of the bandwidth `h` because our code already considered this case.

---

```r
h <- switch(BW,
  "Silver1.06" = 1.06 * s / n^(1/5),
  "Silver0.9" = 0.9 * s / n^(1/5),
  "Silver0.9IQR" = {
    iqr_val <- IQR(x)
    sigma <- min(s, iqr_val / 1.34)
    0.9 * sigma / n^(1/5)
  }
)
```
